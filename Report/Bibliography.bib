  abstract = {I review current efforts to measure the mean density of dark matter near the Sun. This encodes valuable dynamical information about our Galaxy and is also of great importance for 'direct detection' dark matter experiments. I discuss theoretical expectations in our current cosmology; the theory behind mass modelling of the Galaxy; and I show how combining local and global measures probes the shape of the Milky Way dark matter halo and the possible presence of a 'dark disc'. I stress the strengths and weaknesses of different methodologies and highlight the continuing need for detailed tests on mock data - particularly in the light of recently discovered evidence for disequilibria in the Milky Way disc. I highlight several recent measurements in order of increasing data complexity and prior, and, correspondingly, decreasing formal error bars. Comparing these measurements with spherical extrapolations from the Milky Way's rotation curve, I show that the Milky Way is consistent with having a spherical dark matter halo at the Solar position R0. The very latest measures based on \textasciitilde{}10,000 stars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey appear to favour little halo flattening at R0, suggesting that the Galaxy has a rather weak dark matter disc, with a correspondingly quiescent merger history [Abridged].},

  abstract = {We have performed the largest ever particle simulation of a Milky Way-sized dark matter halo, and present the most comprehensive convergence study for an individual dark matter halo carried out thus far. We have also simulated a sample of 6 ultra-highly resolved Milky-way sized halos, allowing us to estimate the halo-to-halo scatter in substructure statistics. In our largest simulation, we resolve nearly 300,000 gravitationally bound subhalos within the virialized region of the halo. Simulations of the same object differing in mass resolution by factors up to 1800 accurately reproduce the largest subhalos with the same mass, maximum circular velocity and position, and yield good convergence for the abundance and internal properties of dark matter substructures. We detect up to four generations of subhalos within subhalos, but contrary to recent claims, we find less substructure in subhalos than in the main halo when regions of equal mean overdensity are compared. The overall substructure mass fraction is much lower in subhalos than in the main halo. Extrapolating the main halo's subhalo mass spectrum down to an Earth mass, we predict the mass fraction in substructure to be well below 3\% within 100 kpc, and to be below 0.1\% within the Solar Circle. The inner density profiles of subhalos show no sign of converging to a fixed asymptotic slope and are well fit by gently curving profiles of Einasto form. The mean concentrations of isolated halos are accurately described by the fitting formula of Neto et al. down to maximum circular velocities of 1.5 km/s, an extrapolation over some 5 orders of magnitude in mass. However, at equal maximum circular velocity, subhalos are more concentrated than field halos, with a characteristic density that is typically \textasciitilde{}2.6 times larger and increases towards the halo centre.},

Plummer and Hernquist spheres are used as models to follow how changes in various parameters of an initially equilibrium stable model depend on \$$\backslash$epsilon\$ and \$dt\$. These dependences are used to derive a criterion for choosing \$$\backslash$epsilon\$ and \$dt\$. The resulting criterion is compared to Merritt's criterion for choosing the softening length, which is based on minimizing the mean irregular force acting on a particle with unit mass. Our criterion for choosing \$$\backslash$epsilon\$ and \$dt\$ indicate that \$$\backslash$epsilon\$ must be a factor of 1.5-2 smaller than the mean distance between particles in the densest regions to be resolved. The time-step must always be adjusted to the chosen \$$\backslash$epsilon\$ (the particle must, on average, travel a distance smaller than \$0.5$\backslash$epsilon\$ during one time-step). An algorithm for solving N-body problems with adaptive variations of the softening length is discussed in connection with the task of choosing \$$\backslash$epsilon\$, but is found not to be promising.},

  abstract = {We present the surface brightness profile of M31's stellar halo out to a projected radius of 175 kpc. The surface brightness estimates are based on confirmed samples of M31 red giant branch stars derived from Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic observations. A set of empirical spectroscopic and photometric M31 membership diagnostics is used to identify and reject foreground and background contaminants. This enables us to trace the stellar halo of M31 to larger projected distances and fainter surface brightnesses than previous photometric studies. The surface brightness profile of M31's halo follows a power-law with index -2.2 +/- 0.2 and extends to a projected distance of at least \textasciitilde{}175 kpc (\textasciitilde{} 2/3 of M31's virial radius), with no evidence of a downward break at large radii. The best-fit elliptical isophotes have b/a=0.94 with the major axis of the halo aligned along the minor axis of M31's disk, consistent with a prolate halo, although the data are also consistent with M31's halo having spherical symmetry. The fact that tidal debris features are kinematically cold is used to identify substructure in the spectroscopic fields out to projected radii of 90 kpc, and investigate the effect of this substructure on the surface brightness profile. The scatter in the surface brightness profile is reduced when kinematically identified tidal debris features in M31 are statistically subtracted; the remaining profile indicates a comparatively diffuse stellar component to M31's stellar halo exists to large distances. Beyond 90 kpc, kinematically cold tidal debris features can not be identified due to small number statistics; nevertheless, the significant field-to-field variation in surface brightness beyond 90 kpc suggests that the outermost region of M31's halo is also comprised to a significant degree of stars stripped from accreted objects.},

However, we demonstrate that if one makes the natural assumption that the tracer density is truncated at rt $>$\textasciitilde{} 160 kpc and falls off significantly more steeply than r-3.5 at r $>$\textasciitilde{} 80 kpc, then these data are consistent with a flat circular-speed curve and a constant velocity anisotropy comparable to that observed for halo stars in the solar neighbourhood. We also consider a more detailed mass model with an exponential stellar disc and an extended non-isothermal dark-matter halo. In this two-component model, the Milky Way's virial radius and mass are rvir \textasciitilde= 200 kpc and Mvir \textasciitilde= 1.5 \texttimes{} 1012Msolar. Still assuming the
tracers' velocity anisotropy to be constant (at $\beta$ \textasciitilde= 0.5), we again find good agreement with the observed $\sigma$(r), so long as the tracer density is truncated near the virial radius. These data by themselves do not allow to differentiate either between different dark-halo or total-mass models for the Milky Way, nor between different
velocity-anisotropy profiles for the tracers.},

  abstract = {Stellar mass distribution in M31 is estimated using optical and infrared imaging data. Combining the derived stellar mass model with various kinematical data, properties of the DM halo of the galaxy are constrained. SDSS observations through the ugriz filters and the Spitzer imaging at 3.6 microns are used to sample the SED of the galaxy at each imaging pixel. Intrinsic dust extinction effects are taken into account by using far-infrared observations. Synthetic SEDs created with different stellar population synthesis models are fitted to the observed SEDs, providing estimates for the stellar mass surface density. The stellar mass distribution of the galaxy is described with a 3D model consisting of a nucleus, a bulge, a disc, a young disc and a halo component, each following the Einasto density distribution (relations between different functional forms of the Einasto density distribution are given in App. B). By comparing the stellar mass distribution to the observed rotation curve and kinematics of outer globular clusters and satellite galaxies, the DM halo parameters are estimated. Stellar population synthesis models suggest that M31 is dominated by old stars throughout the galaxy. The total stellar mass is (10-15)10\^10Msun, 30\% of which is in the bulge and 56\% in the disc. None of the tested DM distribution models can be falsified on the basis of the stellar matter distribution and the rotation curve of the galaxy. The virial mass of the DM halo is (0.8-1.1)10\^12Msun and the virial radius is 189-213kpc, depending on the DM distribution. The central density of the DM halo is comparable to that of nearby dwarf galaxies, low-surface-brightness galaxies and distant massive disc galaxies, thus the evolution of central DM halo properties seems to be regulated by similar processes for a broad range of halo masses, environments, and cosmological epochs.},

In particular, a general analytical formula for the surface density, an important quantity that defines the lensing properties of a dark matter halo, is still lacking to date. To this aim, we used a Mellin integral transform formalism to derive a closed expression for the Einasto surface density and related properties in terms of the Fox H and Meijer G functions, which can be written as series expansions. This enables arbitrary-precision calculations of the surface density and the lensing properties of realistic dark matter halo models. Furthermore, we compared the S$\backslash$'ersic and Einasto surface mass densities and found differences between them, which implies that the lensing properties for both profiles differ.},

  abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard cold dark matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from
simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fitted over two decades in radius by scaling a simple "universal" profile. The characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently its
concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii but are
significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r-2 near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate
estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process, and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.},

  abstract = {We attempt to understand the planes of satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way (MW) and M31 in the context of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), which implies a close MW-M31 flyby \$\{$\backslash$sim 8\}\$ Gyr ago. Using the timing argument, we obtain MW-M31 trajectories consistent with cosmological initial conditions and present observations. We adjust the present M31 proper motion within its uncertainty in order to simulate a range of orbital geometries and closest approach distances. Treating the MW and M31 as point masses, we follow the trajectories of surrounding test particle disks, thereby mapping out the tidal debris distribution. Around each galaxy, the resulting tidal debris tends to cluster around a particular orbital pole. We find some models in which these preferred spin vectors align fairly well with those of the corresponding observed satellite planes. The radial distributions of material in the simulated satellite planes are similar to what we observe. Around the MW, our best-fitting model yields a significant fraction (0.22) of counter-rotating material, perhaps explaining why Sculptor counter-rotates within the MW satellite plane. In contrast, our model yields no counter-rotating material around M31. This is testable with proper motions of M31 satellites. In our best model the MW disk is thickened by the flyby 7.65 Gyr ago to a root mean square height of 0.75 kpc. This is similar to the observed age and thickness of the Galactic thick disk. Thus, the MW thick disk may have formed together with the MW and M31 satellite planes during a past MW-M31 flyby.},

  title = {The Total Satellite Population of the {{Milky Way}}},
  abstract = {The total number and luminosity function of the population of dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way (MW) provide important constraints on the nature of the dark matter and on the astrophysics of galaxy formation at low masses. However, only a partial census of this population exists because of the flux limits and restricted sky coverage of existing Galactic surveys. We combine the sample of satellites recently discovered by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) survey with the satellites found in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 9 (together these surveys cover nearly half the sky) to estimate the total luminosity function of satellites down to \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm V\}=0\$. We apply a new Bayesian inference method in which we assume that the radial distribution of satellites follows that of subhaloes selected according to their peak maximum circular velocity. We find that there should be at least \$142\^\{+53\}\_\{-34\}\$ (\$1$\backslash$sigma\$ CL) satellites brighter than \$M\_\{$\backslash$rm V\}=0\$ within \$300\$ kpc of the Sun. As a result of our use of new data and better simulations, and a more robust statistical method, we infer a much smaller population of satellites than reported in previous studies using earlier SDSS data only; we also address an underestimation of the uncertainties in earlier work by accounting for discreteness effects. We find that the inferred number of faint satellites depends only weakly on the assumed mass of the MW halo and we provide scaling relations to extend our results to different assumed halo masses and outer radii. We predict that half of our estimated total satellite population of the MW should be detected by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).},

  abstract = {We investigate the mass profile of cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) haloes using a suite of numerical simulations spanning five decades in halo mass, from dwarf galaxies to rich galaxy clusters. These haloes
typically have a few million particles within the virial radius
(r200), allowing robust mass profile estimates down to radii $<$1 per cent of r200. Our analysis confirms the proposal of Navarro, Frenk \& White (NFW) that the shape of the $\Lambda$CDM halo
mass profiles differs strongly from a power law and depends little on mass. The logarithmic slope of the spherically averaged density profile, as measured by $\beta$=-dln$\rho$/dlnr, decreases monotonically towards
the centre and becomes shallower than isothermal ($\beta$ $<$ 2) inside
a characteristic radius, r-2. The fitting formula proposed by NFW provides a reasonably good approximation to the density and circular velocity profiles of individual haloes; circular velocities typically deviate from NFW best fits by $<$10 per cent over the radial range that is numerically well resolved. Alternatively, systematic deviations from the NFW best fits are also noticeable. Inside r-2, the profile of simulated haloes becomes shallower with radius more gradually than predicted and, as a result, NFW fits tend to underestimate the dark matter density in these regions. This discrepancy has been interpreted as indicating a steeply divergent cusp with asymptotic inner slope, $\beta$0$\equiv\beta$(r\hphantom{0}= 0) \textasciitilde{} 1.5. Our results suggest
a different interpretation. We use the density and enclosed mass at our innermost resolved radii to place strong constraints on
$\beta$0: density cusps as steep as r-1.5 are
inconsistent with most of our simulations, although $\beta$0= 1 is still consistent with our data. Our density profiles show no sign of converging to a well-defined asymptotic inner power law. We propose a simple formula that reproduces the radial dependence of the slope better than the NFW profile, and so may minimize errors when extrapolating our results inward to radii not yet reliably probed by numerical
simulations.},

In this review, we describe various methods to measure rotation curves in the Milky Way and spiral galaxies. We then describe two major methods to calculate the mass distribution using the rotation curve. By the direct method, the mass is calculated from rotation velocities without employing mass models. By the decomposition method, the rotation curve is deconvolved into multiple mass components by model fitting assuming a black hole, bulge, exponential disk and dark halo. The decomposition is useful for statistical correlation analyses among the dynamical parameters of the mass components. We also review recent observations and derived results.

Allowing for a comparable amount of diffuse mass to fill the volume of the Local Group, we find that the two galaxies are likely to collide in a few billion years - within the Sun's lifetime. During the the interaction, there is a chance that the Sun will be pulled away from its present orbital radius and reside in an extended tidal tail. The likelihood for this outcome increases as the merger progresses, and there is a remote possibility that our Sun will be more tightly bound to Andromeda than to the Milky Way before the final merger. Eventually, after the merger has completed, the Sun is most likely to be scattered to the outer halo and reside at much larger radii ($>$30 kpc). The density profiles of the stars, gas and dark matter in the merger product resemble those of elliptical galaxies. Our Local Group model therefore provides a prototype progenitor of late--forming elliptical galaxies.},

We construct N-body models for M31 to correct the measurements for the contributions from stellar motions internal to M31. We also estimate the center-of-mass motion independently, using the kinematics of satellite galaxies of M31 and the Local Group. All estimates are mutually consistent, and imply a weighted average M31 heliocentric transverse velocity of (v\_W,v\_N) = (-125.2+/-30.8, -73.8+/-28.4) km/s. We correct for the reflex motion of the Sun using the most recent insights into the solar motion within the Milky Way. This implies a radial velocity of M31 with respect to the Milky Way of V\_rad = -109.3+/-4.4 km/s, and a tangential velocity V\_tan = 17.0 km/s ($<$34.3 km/s at 1-sigma confidence). Hence, the velocity vector of M31 is statistically consistent with a radial (head-on collision) orbit towards the Milky Way. We revise prior estimates for the Local Group timing mass, including corrections for cosmic bias and scatter. Bayesian combination with other mass estimates yields M\_LG = M\_MW(vir) + M\_M31(vir) = (3.17 +/- 0.57) x 10\^12 solar masses. The velocity and mass results imply at 95\% confidence that M33 is bound to M31, consistent with expectation from observed tidal deformations. (Abridged)},
